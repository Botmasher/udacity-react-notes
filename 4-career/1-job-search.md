Lesson 1: Conduct a job search

1. Introduction
- not ready to apply to jobs? still work on career dev to be job ready
- be ready when that job comes
- have resume and cover letter ready that can be targeted to spec position
- how to conduct targeted job search?

2. Job search mindset
- exhausting to search through 1000s of jobs
- how to be effective?
	1. know what you want
	2. research what employer wants
	3. be open to opportunity
- knowing what you want avoids job search fatigue
- write down 2-3 you can't compromise on
- distinguish jobs you can do from those you want to do
- open to anything isn't necessarily good thing
	- think how this comes across to employer
	- balance flexibility and focus
- so create targeted job application and get feedback

3. Target your application to an employer
-	find out guidelines so you know what need
- make sure you are interested and passionate (e.g. Udacity people passionate about education)
- dig to find out what they need
	- Udacity hires int'l, so include anything important abt working c int'l teams
	- collaborating across diff't timezones, etc.
	- connecting c and communicating c people
- what if it's not clear?
	- browse through the website: "innovation", "student community", "face-to-face", "job-ready"
	- this is important: you will be asked WHY DO YOU WANT TO WORK HERE
- you might've thought one thing, but after reading find the focus is difft
	- e.g. Udacity isn't about quality content but about educational accessibility
	- this shows you care abt driving the mission
	- this shows your value and can help you stand out among more qualified but less understanding and passionate candidates

4. Open yourself up to opportunity
- openness
	- give it a shot if it is interesting
