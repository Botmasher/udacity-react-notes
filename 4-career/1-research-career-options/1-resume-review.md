Project: Resume Review Project (Entry-level)

1. Convey your skills concisely
- all jobs require resume
- build resume throughout years
- every resume unique, but stil req
- don't focus on cultural diffs e.g. resume in Germany has marital status and pic
- skills here:	
	- take complexity of whole career experience
	- convey concisely for specific job
	- basically, distilling years of work into bullet points

2. Effective resume components
- target to spec job
- employer needs to know what you're looking for
- they match your resume to the job description
- skills here:
	- resume is concise
	- resume connects to what's asked for in the job
- even posting to a board needs to be targeted
- create 1 page and tweak on apply
- tweaking:
	- one page summary of work experience (not life - no hobbies)
	- rearrange skills to emphasize bullet points
	- rewrite certain bullet points
- leave out extras incl references

3. Resume structure
- header:
	- full name
	- contact info
	- link to online profiles
- the rest of resume as "evidence that you're job ready"
	- education and work experience
	- emphasize stronger sections
		- like if lacking work exp, emphasize school clubs and activities, volunteer work, early life awards
		- that section will then be much bigger
		- this allows you to show skills: team work, meeting deadlines, multitasking
	- later rework as gain exp
		- like your edu section may shrink as gain work exp
- this program will give you relevant experience to share
- if previous jobs not related, list projects and education first
- stress what provides "evidence that you're job ready"!
- skill section:
	- short list of skills you've developed across all jobs, projects and learning
	- also keep it very relevant to job you are pursuing
	- spec as possible, not easy things, but things like speaking a spec lang or software dev skills
	- not ones employers assume their workers have or can learn like MS Office
	- "soft skills" are best given in examples
		- not "teamwork" or "communication" but examples of great communication in projects and experience section

4. Describe your work experience
- focus on three things:
	- action: employer only wants you if you can complete assignments and deliver results
	- numbers: give quantitative evidence of your work
		- led a team of 10 people, not led a team
		- my work increased revenue 30%, not increased profits
	- success: not things that clearly quantify or intended but things that you showcase
		- improving efficiency
- ask yourself if each bullet point showcases action, numbers or success

5. Resume reflection
- do quality control
- compare examples or templates online
- don't commit common design errors that draw eye to bad formatting instead of info
- links should be clickable
- no typos
- submit as PDF to preserve formatting
- MAKE SURE it is 1 page
 	- years and years of relevant exp may give a job candidate more than 1 p

6. Resume review
- personalized, detailed feedback
- options:
	- entry level
		- show ready for workforce
		- show serious about new career
		- show relevant skills for job
	- career change
		- for people who move from a very difft career like chef or lawyer
		- same kind of format whatever the previous career
	- prior industry experience
		- web dev also interested in mobile app dev
		- statistician shifting towards machine learning
- if you are not a perfect fit in these, try guidelines for each
