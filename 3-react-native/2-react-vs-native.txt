		Lesson 2: React vs React Native

		- integrate Redux into a React Native app

/* 2. Web vs Native
		- React Native lets you captialize on web dev experience
		- BUT mobile apps are very diff
		- here's what to watch out for:

		(1) animations: button presses, transitions, other subtle feedback is normal for mobile users
			- tell a story about how your app works (return to this in lesson 5)
		(2) navigation: routers function as a STACK, pushing and popping individual screens as needed
			- so a screen is not just a URL mapped to a UI component!
		(3) Android vs iOS design
			- Android: Google's Material Design (https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html)
			- iOS: Apple's Human Interface Design (https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/)
			- so design to make sure each app FEELS LIKE an Android app vs an iOS app
		(4) Android vs iOS navigation
			- Android devices have navigation bar at bottom of screen, universally allowing users to go back/forth btwn screens
			- iOS devices must implement their own navigation (including a back button, maybe a nav bar)
			- tab navigation (to access high-level content): bottom of screen in iOS, top in Android
				- explore React Native's TabNavigator in Lesson 4
