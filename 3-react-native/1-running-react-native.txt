 *	React Native
 * 	1. Up and Running with React Native
 */

/* 1. Introduction
		- most of what you know about React applies
		- start with the benefits and dev environment
		- compare the main ideological diffs and API diffs
		- styling and layout patterns for React Native
		- routing patterns and strategies
		- native functionality like geolocation and notifications, plus publishing

		- Along the way, create a fitness tracker called UdaciFitness
 */


/* 2. What is it and why
 		- use React to build mobile app, letting orgs have single UI team
 		- "write once, run anywhere" is difficult in practice, but React Native: "learn once, write anywhere"
 			- instead of same codebase, same principles
 			- "things like component composition and declarative UI"
 		- goal: same engineers can write both apps, not that the same code runs both apps
 		
 		- Under the hood
 			- Virtual DOM as initially big standout selling point for React
 				- object representation of DOM that it can diff on setState and do "reconciliation"
 			- since DOM is untethered from actual DOM, can do same thing with iOS or Android views
 			- 
 */


/* 3. Dev Environment Setup
		- Create React Native app pros:
			- run command in terminal to have it run on both Android and iOS using JS
			- just need one build tool
			- no lock in since can eject at any time
		- Create React Native cons:
			- if you're building an app added to existing iOS or Android native app, it won't work
			- if need to build own bridge between React Native and some native API Create React App doesn't expose, it won't work

			npm install -g create-react-native-app

		- BUT bc of bugs in npm v5, Create React Native App doesn't work well so use yarn
			https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

			yarn global add create-react-native-app

		- Expo as service that keeps from touching Swift, Objective C, ...
		-	Expo lets us use JS API to get same results we'd expect from touching Xcode or Android Studio
		- Expo team built Create React Native App
			https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779

		- Install simulators for both platforms in order to demo projects for this course
