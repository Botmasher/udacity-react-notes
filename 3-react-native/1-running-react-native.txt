/* 	
 *	React Native
 * 	1. Up and Running with React Native
 */

/* 1. Introduction
		- most of what you know about React applies
		- start with the benefits and dev environment
		- compare the main ideological diffs and API diffs
		- styling and layout patterns for React Native
		- routing patterns and strategies
		- native functionality like geolocation and notifications, plus publishing

		- Along the way, create a fitness tracker called UdaciFitness
 */


/* 2. What is it and why
 		- use React to build mobile app, letting orgs have single UI team
 		- "write once, run anywhere" is difficult in practice, but React Native: "learn once, write anywhere"
 			- instead of same codebase, same principles
 			- "things like component composition and declarative UI"
 		- goal: same engineers can write both apps, not that the same code runs both apps
 		
 		- Under the hood
 			- Virtual DOM as initially big standout selling point for React
 				- object representation of DOM that it can diff on setState and do "reconciliation"
 			- since DOM is untethered from actual DOM, can do same thing with iOS or Android views
