/*
	2. Redux
	Lesson 4: Architect a Redux Store
 */




/* 1. Introduction
	- so far our stores are limited to one reducer
	- this works fine for many small apps
	- let's build towards complex applications
	- let's also make sure we keep the data sane and maintainable
 */




/* 2. combineReducers
	- consider a hypothetical book reducer
		1) a book action is dispatched
		2) the book reducer is called
		3) the reducer returns the book state
	- but what if we extended it to deal with user actions?
		- one option is to modify the book reducer to handle user actions
		- more ideal is to add a reducer to handle user actions
	
	- Wait, Redux createStore() only takes a single reducer!
		- create a root reducer one lvl up that calls both user and book reducers
 */

// hypothetical added "users" reducer
function users (state={}, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case 'ADD_USER':
			return {};
		case 'REMOVE_USER':
			return {};
		default:
			return state;
	}
}

// now the hypothetical two reducers
function users (state={}, action) { ... }
function books (state={}, action) { ... }

/*
	"Reducer Composition"
	- we separated those two out
	- "to handle distinct, independent slices of state"
	- but again Redux.createStore() only accepts ONE reducer
 
 	Back to Udacimeals - when we get API response, where to save recipe in our store?
 	- we could grab the whole recipe object and stick it in the meal
 	- but what if we wanted the same dinner monday and tuesday? DUPES!
 	- Redux: do NOT duplicate data
 	1) make a brand new .food property beside the .calendar property on our state object
 	2) go inside reducers/index.js and make a brand new reducer
 		- this will be a food() reducer
 */

// new reducers index.js food() reducer
function food(state={}, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case ADD_RECIPE:
			const { recipe } = action;
			return {
				...state,
				[recipe.label]: recipe
			};
		default:
			return state;
	}
}
	// now the ADD_RECIPE action dispatch modifies both calendar and food
	// but take a look at your exports - it's the calendar reducer

// make sure in the base app's index.js you're importing reducer from '.reducers/'

/*
	combineReducers()
	- as app grows we often want to have nested objects
	- we want to practice "reducer composition"
		- using multiple reducers
		- with each reducer "responsible for separate, independent portions of state"
		- so below each reducer will be responsible only for, say, users or comments
		{
			users: {},
			comments: {},
			replies: {}
		}
	- the action->reducer pattern still holds in scale
		- each reducer gets section of state
		- each reducer gets an action
		- each reducer returns a new, unmodified section of that same state

	To accomplish what we've been teasing at we:
	1) create separate reducers (like the food vs calendar reducers)
	2) use the Redux combineReducers() method
		- turns an object with multiple reducer functions into a single reducer function
		- we pass this one root reducer into createStore()
		- main reducer calls every child reducer and gathers results
		- gathered results are a new single unified state object
 */

// example of writing a /reducers/root_reducer.js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

function users(state={}, action) { ... }
function books(state={}, action) { ... }

export default combineReducers({users, books,});


// example importing and setting up the store in /store/store.js
import rootReducer from '../reducers/root_reducer'

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
console.log(store.getState()); 			// logs  { users: {}, books: {} }


// Now bring it into Udacimeals
// back in /reducers/index.js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
...
export default combineReducers({food,calendar});
	// check the Redux console to see that you have a food property in the state store
	// you're exporting the COMBINED VALUE of combineReducers here

// within App.js - mapStateToProps is receiving BOTH calendar AND food now
//  - conceptually, calendar now stores food (like calendar:{monday:{breakfast:'pizza'}} )
//  - and all of the food's information can be found under food[id]
//  - so update App state to reflect that we're storing food items not just food names 
// 	- we're now getting calendar as well as food as an object from reducers, so decompose
function mapStateToProps({calendar, food}) {
	calendar: dayOrder.map((day) => {
		day,
		meals: Object.keys(calendar[day]).reduce((meals, meal) => {
			meals[meal] = calendar[day][meal]
			? food[calendar[day][meal]] 		// make sure we're getting the actual food item
			: null
		})
	})
}

/*	After you update your Udacimeals, answer T or F:
	- an alternative to combineReducers() is to pass multiple reducers to createStore()
	- you import combineReducers() from react-redux
	- combineReducers() takes one object as its argument
	- combineReducers() returns one reducer that can be passed in to create the store


	And this quiz: what's wrong with the following root reducer?

	import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
	import booksReducer from './books_reducer';
	import userReducer from './user_reducer';

	const rootReducer = combineReducers(booksReducer, userReducer);

	export default rootReducer;

 */




/* 3. Normalization
 	- we've seen encapsulation of pieces of state into indiv reducers
 	- now focus on architecting store to be (1) easy to reason about and (2) more performant
 	- this process is "normalization of state shape"
 		- a few choices to follow
 		- objective of making sure app runs smoothly

 	Rules
 	1) Do not duplicate data
 		- violates Single Source of Truth 
 		- wastes resources syncing data
 	2) Keep store as shallow as possible
 		- deeply nested data updates get complex quickly

	Redux recommends:
	1) as normalized as possible, without any nesting
	2) every entity is in an object with ID as a key
	3) use ID to reference entity from other entities or from lists
 */

// example of properly referencing info for a list of friends
const people = {
	kassim: {
		name: 'Kassim K',
		age: 24,
		favoriteIceCream: 'vanilla'
	},
	tyler: {
		name: 'Tyler T',
		age: 25,
		favoriteIceCream: 'chocolate'
	},
	amy: {
		name: 'Amy A',
		age: 26,
		favoriteIceCream: 'strawberry'
	}
};
const friends=['amy','kassim'];
const friendsInfo = friends.map(friend => people[friend]);

// example of crazy nested structure not to use
const books = {
	fiction: {
		fantasy: {
			0: {
				title: 'Harry Potter and the Nested Data',
				author: 'JK Rowling'
      		}
    	},
    	romance: {},
    	scifi: {}
  	},
  	nonFiction: {}
};
// imagine the reducer you need for the monster above!!
function books (state, action) {
 	const { bookType, genre, id, title } = action;
  	if (action.type = CHANGE_TITLE) {
    	return {
      		...state,
      		[bookType]: {
        		...state[bookType],
        		[genre]: {
        			...state[bookType][genre]: {
            			[id]: {
              				...state[bookType][genre][id],
              				title,
            			}
          			}
        		}
      		}
    	};
  	}
  	return state;
};
