Project: GitHub Profile Review
Matt Leonard

1. Introduction
- create and update profile
- impress employers by contrib to open src
- if lack exp, take Udacity course on version control c git (I have previously 100% it)
- artists use portfolio, this is a programming portfolio
- you need to take steps to turn your profile into a professional portfolio

2. GitHub profile important items
- profile of Scott Moss, engineer at Udacity
- L shows personal info
	- pic c friendly smile
	- at least incl pic that captures personality if it's not you personally
	- avoid anything crude
	- general info incl links to social media
	- links to personal blog or site
	- username should be sth professional
- Contributions tab
	- most popular repos
		- number of stars based on other GitHub users that liked the repo
		- desc tell you what repos are for
	- repositories contributed to
		- clear indication of involvement and collaboration
		- look through contributions to see how well works on team
		- may focus on contribs to things that are popular
	- contributions chart
		- one of the first things hiring mgr looks at
		- darkness of color indicates how many contribs made on a day
		- spends a lot of time working on code, a good sign

3. Good GitHub repository
- user has recent commits
- user has written much code
-	short, clear description of what the repo is for, e.g. a simple library for making animations in Angular
- link to GitHub page for the library
	- easy to create
	- very impressive
- README
	- one of the most important parts of the repo
	- helps others understand and use code
	- gives users a starting point
- most recent commits show how contributor writes code

4. Interview with Art Gillespie
- what does a recruiter or hiring manager look for in a profile?
- Art sees hiring mgr as collaborative role working c leadership to screen for attributes and get sense of candidates
- first thing looks at is heat map at the bottom
	- steady patterns
	- correlates c success in the workplace
- then look at the repos
	- which have they created
	- which have they contributed to
	- where have they done the meatiest work?
	- pick one and dig in: spend an hour reading their code to see the kind of engineer they are
	- have they contributed to other repos' issues?
	- how do they interact c other people in discussions?
	- are they good collaborators, patient, ... ?

5. Quiz: Identify fixes for example bad profile
https://github.com/acorn47
- better pic
- real name or sth based off real name
- no personal info either
- how to contact as a recruiter?
- no descriptions on repos
- contribution chart shows little time writing code, with only early packed-in commits

6. Quick Fixes #1
- update name and profile pic
- change names of repositories under repository's settings
- comment your code
	- especially any sections that are shown off to an interviewer
	- make sure it's working

7. Quiz: Quick Fixes #2
- Profile Checklist:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a9AKnNyqfGgdQV5ohPCN5H9ntnEUhMptWMwVBWURCN0/pub?embedded=true
- Profile Rubric:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/15B7SBSQ1iKqUjo1UpHHVtqonCzxZwqBaV2lC4mN5N1U/pub?embedded=true

8. Writing ReadMes with Walter
- tells people what the code is for 
- how to build/install
- how to contribute
- Walter has a course on writing documentation for humans

9. Interview with Art #2
- commits are one of the main reasons to use git
- make incremental changes and see what changed every commit
- commit mssg an important part of this
- well-formatted commit
	- helps dig through code to find out what's wrong
	- git blame: if the mssg is just "Added stuff", it's 
	- context for why code changed and why there in the first place
	- for you and others to maintain your code
- hiring mgr definitely checks out commit mssgs

10. Commit messages
- consider the http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/
- subject shows short desc of what changed
	- clearly and informatively
	- less than 51 chars
	- first letter caps
	- end without period
	- Udacity also annotates c type of chg (fix, feat, ...)
- body details why change was made
	- 72 chars per line
	- should fit in terminal window when using git on cmd line
	- blank line btwn subject and body
	- add points using asterisks or dashes if list
- some commits require no body (like typo fixes)
- footer
	- usu just for fixes or bugs addressed
	- e.g. Resolves: #nnn

11. Quiz: Reflect on your commit messages
- how can you make your commits clearer and more helpful?
	- mine almost always lack equiv of a body
	- mine roll up what and why into dense subject
	- mine often give project context, which could be shortened by organizing repos or in general ReadMe
		- perhaps fodder for the footer
	- mine frequently start c the same broad action verbs like "Add", "Remove", "Test"
	- not enough insight into motivation for many changes

12. Participating in open source projects
- employers want to see you can collab
- OS to demonstrate you love code and you can work with others

13. Interview with Art #3
- how do you know if someone is a good collaborator?
	- screen for how well they work c teams
	- branch out from GitHub profile and look at issues to see how they've participated in those threads
	- comments on pull requests
	- sense for how they interact c other engineers
	- are they patient c people newer to the community?
	- are there logs on IRCs they are related to?
	- dig in to see how they interact c engineers publicly
- advice for beginners on getting into OS
	- break the ice c documentation incl ReadMe
	- go thru the ReadMe, clone the project, try to build it, clarify based on probs to update it
	- submit a pull request c a few changes to the ReadMe (almost always accepted)
	- gets over initial hump of being intimidated by the code

14. Participating in open source projects
- consider pydata/pandas
	- check out the issues that users have created
	- help a user c one of these issues
	- create your own issues if you want
		- feature requests
		- bugs
		- documentation
	- start c issues related to the documentation
		- take on the issue
		- fix the documentation
		- make a pull request
- create list of repos you like by starring them
	- do this c libraries you're interested in working on

15. Quiz: Starring interesting repositories
- go through and look for some interesting ones
- as work on nanodegree, it's good to contribute to open source
- look through docs for typos
- look for unclear things in documentation, create issue and ask for help
	- then can rewrite that part and make a pull request
- my addition: actually test the tools (pref ones you already enjoy) and look for strengths, weaknesses

16. Outro
- you should now have a polished GitHub profile
- learned how to format ReadMes
- format repos and commit mssgs
- be a member of the community and see that reflected in your profile
- use the checklist to make sure profile is ready to impress recruiters
- make sure to go through the checklist and meet all requirements
