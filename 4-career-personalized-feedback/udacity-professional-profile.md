Project: Udacity Professional Profile Review

1. Introduction
- profile as direct cxn to [hiring partners](https://www.udacity.com/hire-talent)
- make yourself visible: we'll optimize it below

2. Getting Started
- "My Profile"
- left sidebar or https://classroom.udacity.com/profiles/u/edit
- auto displays portions based on projects submitted and reviewed
- encouraged to edit any of these sections

3. Customizing Your Profile
- do this to stand out from other auto-generated profiles
- final or capstone project
	- communicate why your work is unique
	- recruiter already sees what you've done in the Nanodegree
	- do not describe the specs
	- describe what you built or analyzed
	- describe how you did it
- what recruiters look for
	- want to find the best candidate but not time to look through all
	- make decisions on first impressions, glance for seconds
	- looking for Ruby dev search only thru people seeking that role or Ruby skills / Ruby Nanodegree grad
	1. great, professional first impression
	2. clear snapshot of skills and exp
		- "snapshot" to capture their glance then skim
		- if they like they will look at GitHub or resume
		- too much info makes hard to discern
		- be sure they know what you're looking for
		- be sure they know which skills you have
		- e.g. looking for a data science roll? don't say web dev
	3. make portfolio accessible
		- recruiters will look at your work
		- GitHub prev work, resume or Linkedin
		- every element elaborates on who you are as candidate
		- consistent story aiming at that desired position
	4. make it easy to contact you
		- public Linkedin, no hidden sections to non-connections
		- email on resume
		- GitHub, Kaggle, other accts

4. Top Section
- full name and loc c no errors
- 3-4 recruiting materials links
	- min: resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, Kaggle (if Machine Learning or Data Analyst)
	- if have: personal website, Stack Overflow (either or both impressive to employers)
- display nanodegree program most relevant to current job
	- if multiple are relevant, display them all
	- what would attract employers?
	- e.g. Front-End vs Senior Web Developer, display the most advanced one
	- reviewer, team guide, forum mentor or top forum contrib badges also displayed here
	- badge for regular activity on GitHub if over 100 commits in the last yr
	- Established or Trusted User on Stack Overflow if you are one
- current position and company
- input 1-3 related desired job roles
	- correctly communicate your own exp lvl
- professional photo (recommended but not necessary)

5. Recruitment Data
- really help you stand out
- answer series of questions related to desired field
- each Nanodegree field receives difft questions
- recruiter can read more
- make sure that answers:
	- are personal, thoughtful and professional
	- contain no mistakes
- second section is for refining job prefs
	- display only criteria matching desired roles
	- min: select opportunites that interest you (e.g. full/part time) and add spoken langs
- again, think abt what you're looking for
- Udacity does NOT just want you to find a job
	- would you accept part time but you really want full time?
	- are you really willing to move to all the locations you selected?

6. Skills
- optimize your profile for search
- many auto gen from your completed Nanodegree projects
- edit or hide any of them
- add all your skills BUT only display those relevant to desired job
	- display 8-10 skills and corresponding levels
	- skills should be technical (e.g. "project management" or "technical recruiting" are only acceptable if targeting that spec desired role)

7. Projects
- arguably the most important
- demonstrate skills for the job
- if changing careers, this is where to build employer confidence
- show your strongest and most relevant
- optimize:
	1. add banners to show off project and attract recruiter attn
	2. descriptions should be longer and informative
		- avoid specs ("part of my Nanodegree program")
		- avoid what it does
		- say how you built it
		- why you built it
		- why it matters
		- are there accomplishments? (Hackathon award?)
		- is it live? (small biz site)
		- HIGHLY recommended that you customize project description
		- add photo if want		
	3. personalize your projects section
		- all projects are relevant to the desired job
		- all projects contain concise desc that communicate project purpose and important tech used
		- all project desc begin c action verbs
		- all project links are unbroken and correct
			- optional to incl zip
			- highly rec to incl GitHub, personal site or another pub site like RPubs (employers prefer this to download)
		- all projects are displayed c an img
- highlight your most recent work incl capstone/final
- you can only display 4 so pick best!
- personal projects
	- 1-2 should be personal to stand out
	- even better if one of those is open source
	- these show you're great collaborator and passionate enough to pursue independent opportunities

8. Experience
- display min 2 work experiences
	- most relevant first
- if not long professional bg, use volunteer/commty/leadership exp
