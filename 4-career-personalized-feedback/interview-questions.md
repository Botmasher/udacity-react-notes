Interview Practice Behavioral Questions

1. Practice Makes Perfect!
- here we will practice answering and reflecting on questions from Udacity hiring mgrs, engineers, students
- we will also review job candidate answers from an interviewer's perspective
- experience both sides of the interview process and analyze answers

2. Self-Practice: Behavioral Questions

- straight from the Udacity material:

3. Analyzing Behavioral Answers
- you are about to review job candidates' answers to those questions
- ask yourself:
	- do they use the STAR method?
	- what is their tone of voice?
	- do they answer concisely or get off track?

4. "Tell me about a time when you showed initiative"
	- answerer sets up a situation, summarizes the problem, talks about steps taken, then the results for team and self
	- a bit vague for me to remember or relate to precisely ("drawing systems diagrams" was the most specific thing)
	- but he did check all the boxes
	- tone was clear, calm, practical

	- Udacity analysis:
		- candidate gave great example of taking initiative
		- the example was related to documentation, important but often neglected (a good point I missed!)
		- tone of voice and pacing could improve (too rehearsed)
		- candidate researched before implementing
		- candidate was specific about actions taken and results following from them
		- candidate lacked personalized anecdotes when talking about the impacts (did it help a spec employee?)

5. "What motivates you at the workplace?"
	- started with a list of traits
	- not a clear example of what speaker is like but self-reflection
		- could have used an example instead of saying motivated by deadlines
	- finished with the most important thing, a desire to be a good colleague
		- this colleague-contingency feeling is harder to see as a trait than as concrete examples or consequences

	- Udacity analysis:
		- candidate showed high energy and passion
		- candidate could've been more specific and related passion back to the job
			- good point; I was thinking spec anecdotes but even generally relating it back to dream job/role helps
		- candidate could use fewer hand gestures to make any used gestures stronger
		- candidate gave examples of internal and external motivators but these were not personalized enough

6. "Please tell me about a problem or challenge you encountered and how you dealt with it."
	- situation of dealing c large user base, many of which were loyal
	- gives a lot of extra info about why they did or did not implement spec pieces of the solution
		- including stats about how not all teachers were chosen and how long it was before release
	- near the end starts detailing another subsituation
		- these seem like interlocking problems
		- maybe a little more decomposition would've helped me relate better
	- results extended beyond the simple problem and onto growth of user base/company
	- this is where specific numbers would've been interesting
		- instead of growing userbase or users feeling ownership, numbers and instances
	- user buyin and defensiveness was touted as a "very successful" thing, which is tricky

	- Udacity analysis:
		- candidate's response was long
		- candidate completely answered the question
		- candidate uses lots of filler words
		- candidate spoke more about team than self (this as better for managerial efforts, but still focus on how you mged)
		- candidate explained problem and solution in detail
			- could emphasize larger themes to make sure interviewer does not get lost
		- candidate gave growth as numbers (hmmm, vs I actually thought neglected during results)

7. "What do you know about our company?"
	- starts by saying what kind of research done: where, blogs, website
	- quickly turns to what learned: "What I learned is X is trying to... [do something positive / have some impact]"
	- compares: before thought education stopped at adulthood, then career; now rapid change means people learn thru career
	- aligns c company values
		- puts on display what thinks company does
		- also shares dreams about what can accomplish
	- danger for me is that it's too close to stuff we might all assume as basic knowledge (yes, vids, yes, quizzes)
		- could instead take the time to present the learning as an experience for the interviewee?
		- might rewrap this around the comparative thinking pair above
	- maybe this is the time to pat the company's back though?
		- at least if it's genuine and you agree c the mission?

	- Udacity analysis:
		- candidate took initiative in researching the company
		- candidate understood and summarized mission
		- candidate did not mention roles inside the company :(
		- candidate was enthusiastic and clear
		- candidate made the answer personal instead of listing facts

8. "Tell me about a time when you failed. How did you deal with this situation?"
	- talks abt application built "one time I built... "
		- gathered up in-game demographic data
	- problems: underest data, parsing poorly, used wrong lang
		- didn't think how impact
	- steps: killed hosting provider, bought server
		- pretty much how got thru, found friend that knew more
		- admits messed up
		- deliberately sought out collaborators (a big plus)
	- talks more about friend and what friends knew, not about learning experience for self
		- may be better to talk about the files, the file size, parsing problems, then frame how learned by collaborating
	- very confessional and almost too self-depr, but eager
	- missing clear understanding of the results
		- "turned it into a successful product", what does that success mean and look like today?
	- tone is engaged but not necessarily detail oriented
	
	- Udacity analysis:
		- very positive but candidate could've said what success looked like (hey, we match :D )
		- relevant experience to front-end
		- did not give up
		- showed ability to create own app
		- clearly dealt with trickiness around scale (that's an interesting point I glossed over)
