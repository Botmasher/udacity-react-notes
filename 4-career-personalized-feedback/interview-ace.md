2. Interviews are conversations
- some tips on getting hired
	- it's not a test or an exam
	- do not show up and repeat rehearsed answers
	- do ask questions
	- make it clear that you do not understand something and ask about it
	- communicate what you do know
	- e.g. unclear what "Reviews" were, but once clarified was able to ask questions and reveal knowledge about edu
	- show that you are quick learner c other knowledge
	- dive deeper into question (don't just answer it)
	- be confident: you can research and solve problems

3. STAR method
- How do you handle conflict? How do you solve problems?
- you might get questions like: "Describe a disagreement with a coworker or manager. Why did it happen? How did you handle it?"
	- conflicts will happen
	- this is testing for how you react
	- choose a situation you resolved professionally and productively
- Situation, Task, Action, Result
- Example from Udacity

Situation: "One day before we were going to launch a new feature, a new vulnerability was announced in vendor software we use. Patching the problem adequately meant sliding the already delayed schedule. Another team member and I disagreed about which took precedence, the security patch or the feature release. The marketing department had a lot riding on this deadline.”

Task: "We needed to decide which goal to pursue and work together as a team."

Action: "We decided to look into the details of each problem together. Clearly the deadline was important, but our users’ data might be at risk if we didn’t patch our system. I was tasked to research the security threat more closely, and I realized it did not apply to our users because none of them used that browser which had the vulnerability. So we could just post a message on our website about the browser."

Result: "We were able to release our product feature on time even while taking the time to work together to consider an important issue not everyone agreed with at the time."
