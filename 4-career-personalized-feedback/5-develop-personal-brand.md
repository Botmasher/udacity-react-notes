Lesson 5: Develop Your Personal Brand

1. Why Network?
- makes it more likely to find opportunities
- you can search on sites like Indeed and Dice, but warm leads and access
- local professional groups
- rebrand self on Linkedin profile
- opportunities through meetups
- hard to know where opportunity will come from

2. Elevator Pitch
- quickly communicate value
- short sentences for profiles, meeting people and requesting promotions
- rambling vs answers that sound like have life together
- hearing what you say and thinking about why you say it
- leave out fluff: if you're at event, doesn't that mean you're already interested?

3. Personal Branding
- imagine you have to go through 50 applications and choose 5 candidates
- personal stories stand out
	- passion
	- path to current
	- drive company's mission and innovation
	- how you overcome and solve
- branding and rebranding mult times happens
