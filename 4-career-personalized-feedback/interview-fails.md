Lessons 12 and 13
(Apart from these I stopped numbering "lessons" in this career-personalized-feedback course since they're modular and some are coupled with spec projects)

Lesson 12: Interview fails

1. intro
- these are U interview confessionals
- not to scare you off
- it might feel isolating to interview
- but we all go through the same mistakes and pains
- hopefully you'll remember these are oppty to practice

2. Interviewing fails: Mike Wales
- given 15 mins to write tic tac toe
- this was to be a func that would play the comp (vs human)
- standing at whiteboard
- since plays lots with kids, they play three corners means win the game
	- so he assumed and approached it this way
	- keeps mumbling three corners and win
	- kept trying to win the game of tic tac toe not play the game of tic tac toe
- better
	- write func that just puts an X somewhere
	- worried about winning
- consolation
	- talked c friend later that bombed
	- friend said sat down later and worked thru solution that worked very well

	- took that interview and ALSO failed
- recruiter got in contact AGAIN
	- you're not cut out for engineering summer position
	- would you like to interview for a product position?
