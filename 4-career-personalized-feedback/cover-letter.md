Project: Cover Letter Review

1. Get an Interview with a Cover Letter!
- tell employer why best person for the job
- these still accompany resumes in online submission
- sometimes required
- sometimes expected but optional
- sometimes optional and not look like a letter
- applying to Udacity, did submit but some coworkers did not or just wrote short para
- still need to write short intro
- cover letters anecdotally upping chances of interview
- keys to effective job search
	- know what you want
	- research to understand what the employer wants
	- be open to opportunity

2. Purpose
- provide info that other materials can't convey
- weave narrative to seemingly unrelated work exp
- start c passion for the job
- then connect why work exp are relevant and prepare for this job
- not want this job just for this job but for career and interest
- what's most interesting about this job
- resume as ineffective s targeted letter

3. Cover Letter Components
- 1 page addressed to hiring mgr

- write an intro, 2-3 body paras, conclusion
- find job that interests you
	- pick one you're already qualified for
	- recommended to pick your ideal job

- make a case for yourself
	- even if not meet all req, capable and fast lrnr
	- deserve a chance
- look at job desc
	- which skills do you have?
	- which are you exceptionally good at?
	- which skills do you not have?

4. Write the Introduction
- purpose and professional mission
- name of organization and title of the position
	- small detail goes a long way
	- helps hiring mgr sort through applications
	- reader automatically connects you c job
- if you know someone in the company, ask for a referral
	- can put name in the first para
- focus on why you want company not why they should want you
	- vital to standing out among qualified candidates
	- make it your "professional purpose" and be excited
	- be specific	
	"I am a passionate data analyst fascinated by the opportunities created by the abundance of available data and computing power in the modern accounting industry."
- difft approach to every job and every company  

5. Write the Body
- focus in on things you're exceptionally good at
- being an expert at one thing, employer makes logical conclusion you're expert at others
- does job ask for skills you do not have?
	- use the cover letter to make a case for yourself
	- let's say my only exp is from a ND program
	- spendtime writing about how important what you learned is to you (e.g. data-driven results matter to you if you did the Data Analyst ND)
	- talk about your most advanced projects that required the greatest skills
- qualifications and goals
	- concrete examples of related exp
	- avoid things that can be assumed by glancing at your resume
	- not "built a variety of web apps" but "recently built a website for X. The site's features include an appointment scheduler that factors in time zone divergences and a searchable online drive of meeting notes"
	- show you can develop multiple types of features
	- show that you can meet client deadlines
	- show that you can develop c UX in mind
	- BUT definitely expand on this by desc the languages or frameworks used
	- haing one spec example as better than having a bunch of general sentences
- also give an example where you achieved a lot of great success
- also give an example where you worked on a team
- also give an example where you were challenged to do something you'd never done before

6. Write the Conclusion
- shortest and easiest part
- restate why you want it and why you fit
- logistics
	- are you traveling?
	- are you unavailable before a certain date?
- include a thank you for the recruiter's time
	- humility and gratitude go a long way

7. Format
- check that formatting looks nice before submitting
- make letter as easy as possible to read
- clear, concise, not words crammed into small space
- do not decrease margin and font size just bc have lots to say
- do not make your letter look like a long essay
- justify para to show structure
- include the date (Month DD, YYYY) at top R or L
- include formal address in letter
- address the letter to the recruiter (if name avail)
- if not avail, write to "Dear X Engineering Team:"
	- recruiting team works too
- include a formal salutation like "Regards, My Name"
- rec to use same header from resume as cover letter header
	- looks nice and consistent
