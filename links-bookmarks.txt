Final Project: MyReads
----------------------
Feedback:
- Don't include something in state unless the component changes it
- Things derivable from state (like ostensibly shelves from books) should not be duplicated separately in state
- Init component state in the constructor: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#constructor
- Use Switch for exclusive routing to a 404 error page
- Index as key for looped siblings is a last resort: https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318
	- for me this manifested as books that, once removed from a shelf, would leave their menu state on filled-in item's dropdown
- Good idea on placeholder images but try ones with custom text
- Great job on stateless component but the more the better
- Good job on README.md and TODO.md!
- Use Debounce (like react-throttle) to make sure query input isn't hitting the API before user is done typing
- Good job using ComponentDidMount() correctly

Three principles of Redux:

Functional programming and pure functions:

Diagram of Redux flow from view to action to reducer to store back to view:

Redux dev tools (see lesson 2.4 for second arg to pass to Redux.createStore to make it work):

Currying (to prepare for how react-redux Provider's .connect() method works):

What Redux says about keeping store normalized:
http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html

Normalizr for keeping store free of duplicate data and as shallow as possible:

Creating custom middleware:

Redux Thunk middleware:
https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk

Redux only supports synchronous strict unidirectional data flow, so use middleware:
http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/AsyncFlow.html

Writing async action creators and using Thunk middleware (a thoughtful answer):

Redux best practices - use selectors, do more in action creators less in reducers, write "ducks" tests:
