Part 1, Lesson 1: "Why React?", 5. React is "Just Javascript", .filter() Quiz
Instructions include:
	"store the returned data in a new info variable"
But the expected code uses results and errs when I name the variable "info" instead:
	const results = musicData.filter(album => album.name.length >= 10 && album.name.length <= 25);
	console.log(results);

Part 1, Lesson 2: "Rendering UI with React", 3. Create React App, Yarn Package Manager section
This is noted within the course material. I didn't notice it.
	The observant student might've noticed that my index.js file does not include the line registerServiceWorker(); that's showing in your project. The call to the Service Worker was added in the version of Create React App right after I recorded this video. Since we're not using Service Workers in this project, it won't affect anything. If you want to remove it, though, feel free!
